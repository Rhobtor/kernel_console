# Kernel Console - Custom OS for Gaming Handhelds

A complete custom Linux operating system stack designed for game console handhelds with PDA capabilities.

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Ubuntu/Debian-based Linux system
- ARM cross-compilation tools (auto-installed)
- ~5 GB free disk space
- 2-4 hours for full build

### Build from Source

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/Rhobtor/kernel_console
cd kernel_console

# Setup environment (downloads ~2GB of kernel/busybox sources)
make setup

# Build everything (kernel + OS + initramfs)
# This will take 1-2 hours
make build

# Check output
ls -lh releases/v0.1-pi4/
```

### Install on Raspberry Pi 4

```bash
# See detailed instructions
make install-pi
```

## Project Vision

Building a **multi-version game console and mobile computing device** with custom OS, custom hardware, and full system control.

## Version Roadmap

### **v0.x** (Current) - OS Foundation
- Custom Linux kernel (6.12.60-console-v1+)
- BusyBox minimal OS (2.5 MB initramfs)
- Base architecture and boot system
- **Status:** Core OS complete, build system implemented

### **v1.0** - First Hardware Release
- **Hardware:** Raspberry Pi 4 + Custom PCB
- **Features:** Game controls, battery, charging circuit
- **Software:** Full OS with game launcher
- **Target:** Fully functional gaming handheld

### **v2.0** - Enhanced Version
- **Hardware:** Raspberry Pi 5M + Advanced PCB
- **Features:** Better performance, improved controls, optimized power management
- **Software:** Enhanced launcher, more emulator support

### **v2.5** - Chip Variant
- **Hardware:** Alternative processor variant + Specialized PCB
- **Features:** Performance tuning for specific chip
- **Software:** Optimized drivers and features

### **v3.0** - Next Generation
- **Hardware:** Integrated Graphics + Custom PCB
- **Features:** Native graphics acceleration
- **Software:** Leverages GPU capabilities

## Dual Purpose: Gaming Console + PDA

Each version functions as both:
- **Gaming Console:** Emulators, games, full game launcher
- **Mobile Computer:** File management, networking, applications

## Current Development Phase: v0.x OS Design

### What's Done ✅
- Custom compiled kernel (ARM aarch64)
- Minimal BusyBox rootfs (300+ tools)
- Complete initramfs boot system
- SD card access from custom OS
- 8-phase comprehensive documentation
- **Reproducible build system** ← NEW!
- 8-phase comprehensive documentation

### What's Next 📋
1. Game controller input handling
2. Graphics rendering (framebuffer/SDL2)
3. Game launcher UI
4. Emulator integration
5. Battery management framework
6. PDA applications

### Planned Learning & Development 🎓
- **PCB Design:** Custom control layouts, power management, charging circuits
- **Embedded Programming:** Driver development, hardware integration
- **Software Architecture:** Modular design for multi-version deployment
- **Game Development:** Emulator optimization, game integration

## Technical Stack

- **Kernel:** Linux 6.12.60 (custom compiled)
- **Userspace:** BusyBox
- **Language:** Shell scripts, C (for drivers/apps)
- **Build System:** Make, Kconfig

## Key Features of Custom OS

✓ **Minimal Footprint:** 2.5 MB compressed, runs entirely in RAM
✓ **Independence:** Doesn't rely on traditional Linux distro
✓ **Hardware Control:** Direct access to all hardware via /proc and /sys
✓ **Performance:** Optimized for gaming and PDA use
✓ **Scalability:** Same base OS across all hardware versions
✓ **Flexibility:** Easy to add emulators, games, and applications

## Long-term Goals

- Support 5+ hardware versions
- Unified OS codebase across versions
- Professional gaming handheld device
- Feature parity between gaming and PDA modes
- Community support and customization
